# Google Sheets SQL Query - Course Materials

## Overview
This course covers how to use SQL queries in Google Sheets to analyze and manipulate data efficiently. It includes basic, advanced, and performance optimization techniques, along with datasets and example queries.

## Sections

### 1. Basic Google Sheets with SQL
- Using one sheet with **100+ rows**
- Introduction to Google Sheets Query Language
- **Basic SQL Operations**:
  - SELECT (Extract specific columns)
  - ORDER BY (Sorting data)
  - WHERE (Filtering data)
  - Aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)

### 2. Advanced Google Sheets with SQL Query
- Using **multiple sheets & complex queries** (1000+ rows dataset)
- **Advanced SQL Operations**:
  - Joining multiple sheets (ARRAYFORMULA & VLOOKUP)
  - Filtering with multiple conditions (WHERE + AND/OR)
  - Grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY + COUNT & AVG)
  - UNION equivalent (ARRAYFORMULA)
  - Extracting data (LIMIT equivalent)
  - Finding patterns (LIKE equivalent using MATCHES)

### 3. More Advanced Insights
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Reduce data range (`A:A` â†’ `A1:A1000`)
  - Store query results in a separate sheet
  - Convert large formulas to static values
- **Formula Simplifications**:
  - Use helper columns instead of complex queries
  - Replace QUERY with ARRAYFORMULA where applicable
- **Using Google Apps Script for Complex Queries**

### 4. Practice Datasets & Exercises
- **Dataset**: [Google Sheet Link]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/your_actual_dataset_link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FRvmMF5WQWl7wJ4tW9jnKZlCgMu40wYVl6xNymmc0Q4/edit?usp=sharing))
- **Practice SQL Queries** included for hands-on learning

## Getting Started
1. Open Google Sheets and load the dataset.
2. Apply SQL queries using `QUERY` function.
3. Experiment with provided example queries.
4. Optimize performance with best practices.
